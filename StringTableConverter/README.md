This is an old ArmA2 to ArmA3 string table converter, this Programm would take a .csv file and convert it into a .xml file. With proper XML syntax.

This Software was once publised on Armaholics and recived good feedback from the Modding community which at the time Ported many mods from ArmA2 into ArmA3.
